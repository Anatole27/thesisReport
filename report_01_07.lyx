Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This master's thesis investigates active structural damping for tactical
 missiles.
 The study is based on the case of ASTER 30 - a defense missile - in longitudina
l bending.
 The aim is to replace the structural filter of the autopilot by an active
 damping loop to reduce the bending oscillations, the seeker noise and the
 parasitic actuations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The body of research for active damping is very weak concerning missiles.
 In this work, a new aero-servoelastic model is derived based on an hybrid
 actuated airframe comprising thrust vectoring and fins.
 The structural model is derived on an original bending Euler Bernoulli
 beam discretized in the free-free case.
 The flexible-body modes are extracted and integrated into the longitudinal
 rigid-body flight dynamics model.
 A strain gauge, gyroscopes and accelerometers are optimally placed on the
 aiframe with an adapted method.
 Finally, three active damping and latax controllers are designed with a
 H
\begin_inset Formula $_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 structured tuning to replace the structural filter.
 The active damping is performed using the additional sensors and the central
 fins.
 The work concludes on the feasibility of active damping based on tracking,
 actuators demand, vibrations damping, parasitic actuations and stress alleviati
on.

\begin_layout Section
Motivations for Active Damping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As aerial threats capabilities improve, countermeasure technology must developp
 at a faster pace to ensure national safety.
 This encourages missile manufacturers to design defense missiles with a
 miss distance always smaller and faster interceptions.
 New missiles concepts require hypersonic speeds - more thrust and less
 drag - needing multistage rocket engines and a reduced cross-section.
 These extremely slender shapes encounter low frequency vibrations created
 by bending oscillations.
 The structure and flight dynamics interaction is a source of noise for
 the seeker and other critical sensors.
 This noise also propagates through the system and creates parasitic actuations
 as illustrated on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Bending-Effects"

\end_inset

.
 These parasitic actuations waste energy and affects stability.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To deal with these issues, structural filters are usually used to remove
 structural noise from the sensors measurements and to avoid parasitic actuation.
 However this add a significant phase loss for the control and it curbs
 the missile fastest dynamics by cutting off high frequency signals.
 These structural filters do not remove the dynamic structural deformations
 neither.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another solution which is not used yet is active damping.
 With recent sensors and actuators technology enhancement, this technique
 has become attractive.
 Sensors industries have made a great step in miniaturisation accompagnied
 with a fast reduction of costs.
 Microelectromechanical gyroscopes and accelerometers offer a satisfactory
 accuracy at reduced sizes and affordable prices.
 Active damping requires several sensors and their intrusivity must be limited.
 In the mean time, actuators used to control missiles have now larger bandwidths
 but are often curbed by structural filters.
 The extra bandwidth gained by removing the filters could be used to actively
 damp the structural vibrations.
 Active damping has also the advantage of directly reducing the bending
 oscillations which can remove constraints on the airframe structural stiffness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis investigates how active damping can be conducted on an existing
 anti-missile missile.
 The airframe dynamics will be modeled and several sensors will be placed
 in order to design and assess active damping controllers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Contributions to Knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study contributes to knowledge in active damping on different points
 listed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Elaboration of a servo-aeroelastic model for slender missiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discretized Euler-Bernoulli beam dynamics model for the free-free case with
 variable cross-section
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple sensors placement applied to missiles for bending sensitivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design of three active damping and latax controllers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The servo-aeroelastic model is derived using a linear time invariant longitudina
l aerodynamic model having interactions with a dynamic bending beam model
 of the missile.
 The flight dynamics consider only the longitudinal short period pitch oscillati
ons (SPPO) mode since other modes like the phugoïd have a time scale which
 belongs to the navigation dynamics.
 The servo-aeroelastic model can thus be used to simulate lateral acceleration
 generation with benging oscillations for slender missiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discretized Euler-Bernoulli beam dynamics model is based on the work
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "prentis1963leckie"

\end_inset

 and applied to a frame which extremities are free.
 The bending stiffness and linear mass density is non uniform along the
 beam.
 This structural dynamic model has the advantage of being simple and computation
aly efficient for bending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sensors placement is investigated using the method from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gawronski2004modal"

\end_inset

 and adapted to strain gauges, gyroscopes and accelerometers for the first
 bending mode.
 From a set of possible locations for a sensor, the method consists in finding
 optimal locations to sense the first bending mode state using the H
\begin_inset Formula $_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 norm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the results of the previous points, three controllers have been
 designed to both damp bending vibrations and control lateral acceleration
 in the mean time.
 These controllers use simple SISO feedbacks with an H
\begin_inset Formula $_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 structured tuning.
 They are then assessed with several criterias like robustness, tracking,
 actuators demand and parasitic propagation of vibrations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Thesis Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thesis is divided in four main Chapters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 gives an insight to the problem of active damping in structures with a
 literature survey followed by a preliminary study on a simple 2-part missile
 model.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:flexiMissileModel"

\end_inset

 explains the modeling process in details to obtain the servo-aeroelastic
 model which will be used in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:autopilots"

\end_inset

 where several autopilots are designed and assessed.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 summarizes the findings and discuss further the assumptions made and the
 results obtained.
 Finally Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:conclusions"

\end_inset

 gives conclusions on the feasibility of active damping for missile systems
 and presents further studies arising from this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is advised to read the first Section of Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:flexiMissileModel"

\end_inset

 to understand the missile on which this study is based.
 However, a reader familiar with flight dynamics can skip the section dealing
 with them which is detailed and tutorial.
 The three last Sections of Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 gives important assumptions on which the model is based.
 Chapters

Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Active damping of structures involves different fields from flight dynamics,
 structure dynamics but also sensors and actuators technology for missiles
 and optimal sensors and actuators placement.
 A literature survey will be made to give an insight in these domains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Structure Active Damping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large structures often present issues with oscillations.
 The main structural modes have very low damping ratio and the oscillation
 energy do not dissipate fast enough.
 In some cases, it is preferable to damp actively these oscillations using
 actuators instead of passive damping using dampers.
 Indeed active damping can turn to be light than passive damping and to
 adapt thoughout the structure life whereas passive dampers might be heavy
 and inefficient if the mass or stiffness of the structure change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Active damping is encountered in civil engineering for tall skycrapers.
 These structures are exceptionally slender and excited by winds and sometimes
 seisms.
 The elastic and cinetic energy stored must be dissipated with active systems.
 Civil engineers use tuned mass dampers (TMD) - huge masses mounted on cylinders
 - to counter oscillations.

Large space structures with similar scales have the same issue.
 On Earth, air in which structures evolve like Taipei 101 is a major actor
 in damping however in space vacuum, large satellites lattice like the ISS
 on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ISS"

\end_inset

 are very lightly damped.
 The source of excitation in this case is not the environment but the system
 itself.
 The attitude control creates structural deformations and oscillations that
 must be damped.
 For such structures, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "joshi1991spaceStructures"

\end_inset

 considers the spacecraft attitude control and structural damping as a whole.
 Indeed structural modes and rigid-body modes are highly coupled and must
 be controlled in the same MIMO loop.
 The method consists in establishing a state space model that comprises
 both rigid-body modes and flexible modes.
 For smaller systems like defense missiles, the interaction between the
 structure and the attitude is also probable but at a higher speed.

Active damping for satellites is commonplace because the flexible-body dynamics
 are slow but it is a different story for smaller flying structures.
 Structural dynamic instabilities are encountered by fixed-wing aircrafts
 at high speeds.
 This happens when the airflow interacts with the first bending mode and
 the first twisting mode of the wings.
 This interaction called flutter is often unstable and leads to the destruction
 of the airframe.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "waszak1992flutterSuppression"

\end_inset

 an active flutter suppression technique is investigated.
 This study has been published in 1992 and demonstrates the possibility
 of active damping with a few accelerometers using the trailing edge control
 surfaces on the Active Flexible Wing at NASA Langley Research Center.
 The concept is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AFW"

\end_inset

.
 And allowed the AFW to perform an aggressive roll at a dynamic pressure
 10% over flutter dynamic pressure.

This previous study designed two independant controllers, one to generate
 the roll and another one to suppress flutter.
 However these controllers might interact and spoil each others performance.
 In this context, Meirovitch derives a model for a UAV executing time-dependant
 manoeuvres in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "meirovitch2005timeDependantManeuvers"

\end_inset

.
 The model is divided in two submodels where the first one is a classical
 non linear flight dynamics model along a pre-defineds trajectory for a
 conventional aircraft while the second one receiving inputs from the first
 contains small perturbations from the nominal trajectory in which structural

 This yields a very complex time-varying model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If space structures active damping, builind tuned-mass damper and flutter
 suppression have been thoroughly studied, applications of active damping
 for missiles or rockets are very limited in the public domain.
 Manufacturers are used to design aiframes very stiff and use a structural
 filter to remove parasitic actuations due to vibrations.
 These constraints lead to heavy structures and the controller fastest speed
 is limited by the structural filter which cuts every high frequency signals
 off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sensors for Structure Monitoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step in active damping is sensing the vibrations.
 Appropriate sensors must be chosen for this function.
 They should be non intrusive to ease their integration in the airframe
 and possibly low cost.
 In this context four types of sensors will be presented: strain gauges,
 gyroscopes, accelerometers and more recently distributed strain sensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strain gauge is a widespread device to measure local strains on the surface
 of a structure.
 This sensor is a long resistor stuck on the surface.
 When it is stretched or compressed, its electrical resistance changes.
 This electrical resistance variation is measured using a Weathstone bridge
 and gives information on the local strain.
 With this strain measurement and a resonably accurate model of the structure,
 one can infere on the global structure shape.
 Last generations of these sensors can be very tiny as shown on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 This strain gauge is manufactured by Nanolike using gold nanoparticles.

Gyroscopes and accelerometers are also very widespread and exist under a
 large variety.
 In this study, a gyroscope is considered as a sensor give a rotation rate
 and not an attitude angle.
 This distinction is important to make when a controller will be derived.
 The smallest and cheapest gyroscopes and accelerometers use microelectromechani
cal systems (MEMS).
 A 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) inertial measurement unit (IMU) can measure
 rotation rates and inertial accelerations in all 3 axes and is not bigger
 than a centimetre squared.
 It consists of 3 chips as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 One is a single axis gyroscope, one is a dual-axis gyroscope and the third
 one is a 3-axis accelerometer.

 Indices are created for each potential location for all structural modes

Actuators of ASTER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASTER is featured with three types of propulsion mechanisms.
 During the acceleration phase, the booster controls the trajectory using
 thrust vectoring.
 After the separation, an hybrid system called PIF PAF takes over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thrust vectoring is a propulsion and control technique using thrust
 to accelerate but also to steer.
 The nozzles from which the flames arise are orientable with cylinders.
 The deflection of the flames can generate pitching moments, yaw moments
 and roll moments.

 For missiles flying at 
\begin_inset Formula $30\,km$
\end_inset

 of altitude, thrust vectoring becomes indispensable because the dynamic
 pressure is too weak for conventional control surfaces.
 The advantage of thrust vectoring is also the possibility of high angle
 of attack manoeuvres.
 The main disadvantages however are the slowness of this actuator, its weight,
 its complexity and also its inaccuracy in magnitude and orientation.

 The angles

 The bending deflection is less than a millimeter.
 This will be usefull to make assumptions on the magnitude of deformation
 and and interactions between the aerodynamics and the structure.
 In particular, it will be assumed that the aerodynamics do not have to
 take account of the deformation of the missile and the structure is not
 deformed by aerodynamic forces along the body but only by the lateral forces
 generated using the thrust vectoring or the fins.
 This preliminary study of extreme simplicity only accounts for one bending

 short to long range in service since 2001.
 These missiles are composed of two parts: the booster and the terminal
 dart.
 Very shortly after the launch, the missile steer severely with a high angle
 of attack which create big bending moments as shown on Figure

These missiles can generate lateral forces with two elements.
 The first being the thrust vectoring at the tail.
 Two nozzles are actuated with hydraulic cylinders and can orientate the
 thrust to generate pitching and yawing moments.
 The second element are fins at the tail of the dart.
 Although these control surfaces are generally not used during the acceleration
 phase, they will be considered in this thesis for active damping purposes.
 The deflection of the fins can create a lateral force or a rolling moment.
 They also create little pitching and yawing moments because of their distance
 from the centre of gravity.

The defense missile is equipped with several sensors for tracking and control.
 In particular it has a seeker in the nose and is featured with accelerometers

ASTER 30 is exceptionally slender and subject to bending.
 The link that binds the booster and the dart is thus very stiff and complex

 seeker and for the inertial measurement unit.

\begin_inset Formula $m_{booster}=310\,kg$
\end_inset

 and will lose mass along the acceleration phase.
 However, its mass is considered as constant and equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $310\,kg$
\end_inset

 to simplify the model.
 The dart weights 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{dart}=140\,kg$
\end_inset

 during the complete flight.
 The total mass of the missile is then 
\begin_inset Formula $m=450\,kg$
\end_inset

 The mass linear density is assumed to be uniform in the booster and in
 the dart.
 The length of the booster is

The center of gravity (

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{CG}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\,L_{booster}\,m_{booster}+(L_{booster}+\frac{1}{2}L_{dart})\,m_{dart}}{m}
\]

\end_inset

 that yields 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{CG}=1.86\,m$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rotational inertia at the center of gravity and about the y-axis is
 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{y}=\int(x-x_{CG})^{2}dm$

Aerodynamics

\begin_layout Standard
An aerodynamic model is needed to derive the equations of motion.
 Slender bodies aerodynamics are usually highly non linear but this model
 will be considered as linear for simplicity and will be valid only for
 little angle of attacks.
 The atmosphere and the variation of air density will first be defined,
 then the main body aerodynamics will be described ending with the fins
 aerodynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Standard Atmosphere
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the atmosphere model, the International Standard Atmosphere is considered.
 We consider the missile flying at sea level.
 Thus the air density is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1.21\,kg.m^{-3}$
\end_inset

 and the temperature is 
\begin_inset Formula $T=15\text{°C}=298.15\,K$

\begin_layout Standard
The reference surface for this type of airframe is the cross-section of
 the missile.
 The biggest cross-section is located at the booster and will be taken as
 reference surface.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ref}=\nicefrac{\pi D_{booster}^{2}}{4}$
\end_inset

 The length reference will be the largest diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{ref}=D_{booster}.$

The lift coefficient slope in this paper is

\begin_inset Formula $C_{m\alpha}=45\,rad^{-1}$

 This coefficient places the aerodynamic center at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{AC}=\frac{L_{ref}C_{m\alpha}}{C_{L\alpha}}+x_{CM}=1.52\,m$

 The aerodynamic center in this paper is too fore compared to the center
 of gravity at

 Indeed the accuracy of about 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.25°$

 The aerodynamic center will be placed

\end_inset

 aft of the center of gravity at

\begin_layout Standard
The second equation gives the lift equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

 Solving this system of equation gives the following result:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
\alpha_{0} & =37\cdot10^{-3}\,rad=2.1\text{°}\\
T_{0} & =72.2\,kN\\
\theta_{T0} & =-18\cdot10^{-3}\,rad=-1.0\text{°}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this trim state, the lift is only 
\begin_inset Formula $L=3.0\,kN$
\end_inset

 and the weight of the missile is 
\begin_inset Formula $W=4.4\,kN$
\end_inset

 thus thrust vertical component accounts for one third of the lifting forces.
 Thrust vertical component is 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}\,\sin(\theta_{T0}+\alpha_{0})=1.4\,kN$
\end_inset

.
 The drag is only 
\begin_inset Formula $D=11.6\,kN$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to 16% of the thrust.
 The majority of the thrust is generated to accelerate.
 This gives an insight on the efforts magnitude applied on the airframe.

State Space System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state vector considered for the state-space model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\bar{\alpha}\\
q
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the pitch rate and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 from the trim value 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{\alpha}=\alpha-\alpha_{0}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state vector is only of dimension 2 because
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\gamma}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are navigation variables and have very slow dynamics.
 Indeed this study is interested about lateral acceleration generation,
 which happens faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input vector here is 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\bar{\theta_{T}}\\
\delta_{F}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\theta_{T}}$
\end_inset

 is the deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{T}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{T0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{F}$
\end_inset

 is the fins deflection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output vector is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=\left[\begin{array}{c}
q\\
a_{z_{a}CG}\\
\bar{a_{z_{b}10}}\\
\bar{a_{z_{b}54}}\\
\bar{a_{z_{b}83}}\\
\bar{a_{z_{b}92}}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{a}CG}$
\end_inset

 is the inertial acceleration normal to the speed vector at the center of
 gravity, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{b}i}$
\end_inset

 is the inertial acceleration normal to the body at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{i-1}{99}L$
\end_inset

.
 This notation will make more sense when nodes will be defined in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Structural-Model"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{a_{z_{b}i}}$
\end_inset

 is the deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{b}i}$
\end_inset

 from the trim value 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{b}i0}$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{b}i0}$
\end_inset

 is not zero.
 The missile is in constant acceleration at about 
\begin_inset Formula $15\,g$
\end_inset

 and has a trim angle of attack of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0}=37\cdot10^{-3}\,rad$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{b}i0}=15\cdot0.037=0.55\,g$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{b}i}$
\end_inset

 will vary with a change in angle of attack because of the forward acceleration
 projected normaly to the body.
 The missile onboard computer is able to substract this component on the
 lateral acceleration.
 Signal processing is not the purpose of this study thus it will be assumed
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{a_{z_{b}i}}=a_{z_{a}i}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that an accelerometer fixed on the body is assumed to measure
 the inertial acceleration normal to the speed vector.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z_{a}i}$
\end_inset

 will now be simply denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{zi}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=\left[\begin{array}{c}
q\\
a_{zCG}\\
a_{z10}\\
a_{z54}\\
a_{z83}\\
a_{z92}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pitch rate 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z83}$
\end_inset

 are measured to control the rigid-body states of the missile.
 These measurements are already integrated in the current version of ASTER
 30.
 The acceleration measurements at nodes 10, 54 and 92 will be used to measure
 the vibrations due to bending oscillations.
 The vibration components of these accelerations will be added later.
 The lateral acceleration of the center of gravity is an output to assess
 the system.
 Indeed, the controller will make this output equal to the reference acceleratio
n.

Actuators Dynamics

\begin_layout Standard
The missile is directed with thrust vectoring.
 The two nozzles at the tail of the missile are mounted with hydraulic cylindres.
 The nozzles can be oriented to create a lateral component of thrust that
 will generate a moment at the center of gravity.
 This moment will change the angle of attack of the missile to create a
 lateral acceleration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its bandwidth is estimated to be up to 
\begin_inset Formula $25\,Hz$

 The actuator dynamic is thus represented with a second order transfer function
 of cutoff frequency of

ASTER 30 length is 4.9 m and the largest diameter is 0.36 m on the booster
 hence the missile can be considered as a beam with variable cross section.
 Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is suitable here because higher order models
 like Timoshenko beam theory would bring additive complexity and precision
 that are not needed for this study.
 Therefore sections rotational inertia and shear deformation are neglected.
 For the purpose of this study, only bending along y-axis is considered
 so deformations of the missile are contained in the zx-plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the acceleration phase, ASTER 30 is composed of two parts: the booster
 and the dart.
 Both of them can be modeled as cylindrical pipes.
 The booster section has a diameter of 36 cm and the dart is 18 cm wide.
 The skin thickness

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{z_{i}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{z_{i}}$

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the number of nodes needed, one can consider looking at the
 natural frequencies of the beam converging as 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 grows.
 On Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The method to do so will be explained later.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 varying between 7 and 300.
 The frequency converges when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 increases.
 Eventually 
\begin_inset Formula $n=100$
\end_inset

 is a good choice to minimize the number of nodes for computational efficiency
 and having an acceptable accuracy on natural frequencies.
 Indeed, at about 
\begin_inset Formula $n=100$
\end_inset

, the frequency oscillates between 
\begin_inset Formula $20.02\,Hz$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $20.36\,Hz$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.7\,\%$
\end_inset

 of variation.
 It is worth noting that the uncertainty on the real first mode frequency
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\%$
\end_inset

 so with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=100$

, the first mode frequency can be said as converged.

 The missile is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, thus the local rotational

\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 The damping 
\begin_inset Formula $D'$

 next trick.
 With these hypotheses, the lower part of Equation

 concerning rotational accelerations becomes :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
The stiffness matrix is then 
\begin_inset Formula $K=K_{11}-K_{12}K_{22}^{-1}K_{21}$

\end_inset

 The second-order structural equation is as follows:
\end_layout

Output equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three types of sensors are investigated in this paper to measure vibrations:
 strain gauges, gyroscopes and accelerometers.
 Their measurements can be represented by the output equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y=C_{oz}z+C_{ov}\dot{z}+D_{o}F\label{eq:outputEqGeneral}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is a vector containing the measurement of all sensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It means that the signal measured by the sensors are a linear combination
 of the displacement of the nodes (matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{oz}$
\end_inset

), their speed (matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{ov}$
\end_inset

) and also a feedforward term 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{o}$
\end_inset

 on the external forces applied on the nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Gyroscope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gyroscope on node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 measures 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta_{i}}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 gyroscopes can be placed.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is often used to represent the pitch rate, this letter will be used for
 gyroscope output matrices.
 According to Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:relationThetaZ"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=-K_{22}^{-1}K_{21}z$
\end_inset

, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta_{i}}=-K_{22}^{-1}K_{21}\dot{z}.$
\end_inset

 This yields the output matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{ozq}=0_{n\times n}\qquad C_{ovq}=-K_{22}^{-1}K_{21}\qquad\text{and}\qquad D_{oq}=0_{n\times n}

 With an accelerometer on each node, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 accelerometers.
 In Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Strain gauge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a strain gauge, a first order Taylor developpement to approximate the
 spatial derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(x)$
\end_inset

 at node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 will be conducted.
 This approximation cannot be made on nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 therefore, only 
\begin_inset Formula $n-2$
\end_inset

 strain gauges are considered.
 The letter used for this sensor is 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 which is often assigned to strains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory assumes that each section stays perpendicular
 to the neutral axis.
 The strain gauges are placed on the upper side of the missile therefore,
 the local deformation at the surface is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon(x)=-\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial x}\frac{D(x)}{2}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $D(x)$
\end_inset

 is the local missile diameter.
 It is worth noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon(x)$
\end_inset

 is positive when the strain gauge is stretched and negative when it is
 compressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $i\in\llbracket2,n-1\rrbracket$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial x}(x_{i})\simeq\frac{\theta_{i+1}-\theta_{i-1}}{2\,l}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon_{i}=\frac{-\theta_{i+1}+\theta_{i-1}}{2\,l}\,\frac{D_{i}}{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=(\varepsilon_{i})_{i\in\llbracket2,n-1\rrbracket}$
\end_inset

, then the previous equation yields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon=T_{\varepsilon}\theta
\]

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\varepsilon}=\frac{1}{4\,l}\left[\begin{array}{cccccccc}
D_{2} & 0 & -D_{2} &  &  &  &  & \text{\huge0}\\
 & D_{3} & 0 & -D_{3}\\
 &  & D_{4} & 0 & -D_{4}\\
 &  &  & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots\\

\text{\huge0} &  &  &  &  & D_{n-1} & 0 & -D_{n-1}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, using Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:relationThetaZ"

\end_inset

, the relation becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon=-T_{\varepsilon}K_{22}^{-1}K_{21}z
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{oz\varepsilon}=-T_{\varepsilon}K_{22}^{-1}K_{21}\qquad C_{ov\varepsilon}=0_{(n-2)\times n}\qquad\text{and}\qquad D_{o\varepsilon}=0_{(n-2)\times n}

\end_inset

Therefore
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Subsection
Rigid-body Modes Elimination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second-order structural model and its output equation in there modal
 forms have been derived.
 However, the two rigid-body modes - translation and rotation - must be
 eliminated.
 Indeed, this Chapter aims at modeling only vibrations during the flight.
 The rigid-body dynamics modeled have been derived isolated from gravity
 and air and do not reflect flight dynamics hence they must be suppressed
 to keep only vibrations dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{m}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{m}$
\end_inset

 are diagonal meaning that there is no interaction between modes in Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "2ndOrderStructModal"

\end_inset

.
 The rigid-body modes are eliminated by erasing the two first rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

.
 Hence it is now 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi=[\phi_{1}\,\phi_{2}\,\dots\,\phi_{n-2}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{m}$
\end_inset

 only contains structural modes displacement.
 By doing so, modal mass, damping and stiffness matrices size is now 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-2)\times(n-2)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the output Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:outputEqGeneral"

\end_inset

, truncating the rigid-body modes will remove rigid-body pitch rate and
 strain measurement is not influenced by rigid-body modes.
 However, great care must be taken for the acceleration measurement as 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{oa}\ne0$
\end_inset

.
 To compute the acceleration measurements only due to the vibrations, the
 acceleration measurements due to the rigid-body modes will be calculated
 considering a rigid structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the missile is considered as a solid, the equation of lateral acceleration
 at the center of gravity is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{z,CG}=\frac{1}{m}F_{z}
\]

\end_inset

and the equation of rotational acceleration is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ddot{\theta}=\frac{1}{J_{y,CG}}M_{y,CG}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{z}$
\end_inset

 is the sum of external forces along the z-axis, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{y,CG}$
\end_inset

 is the sum of moments applied at the center of gravity along the y-axis,
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{y}$
\end_inset

 are the mass and rotational inertia about the center of gravity along the
 y-axis.
 The force and moments are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{z}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}F_{j}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{y,CG}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_{CG}-x_{j})\,F_{j}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rigid-body acceleration at each node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{z,rb,i}=a_{z,CG}+(x_{CG}-x_{i})\,\ddot{\theta}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, it yields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{z,rb,i}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}F_{j}+(x_{CG}-x_{i})\frac{1}{J_{y}}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_{CG}-x_{j})\,F_{j}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In matrix formulation, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{z,rb}=D_{oa,rb}\,F
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{oa,rb}=\frac{1}{m}Id_{n}+\frac{1}{J_{y}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{CG}\\
x_{CG}-l\\
\vdots\\
x_{CG}-(n-2)l\\
x_{CG}-(n-1)l
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
x_{CG} & x_{CG}-l & \dots & x_{CG}-(n-2)l & x_{CG}-(n-1)l\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the output matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{oa,rb}$
\end_inset

 is subtracted from 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{oa}$
\end_inset

 to obtain the output matrix from vibrations only :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{oa,fb}=D_{oa}-D_{oa,rb}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this is not completely correct.
 Indeed, the rigid-body dynamics are different when the missile is considered
 as flexible.
 Therefore the rigid-body component in 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{oa}$
\end_inset

 is not 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{oa,rb}$
\end_inset

.

 This is incorrect because at

In the previous part,

 To eliminate properly rigid-body dynamics measured by acceleration sensors,
 the following technique can be used.
 The acceleration due to rigid-body dynamics is composed of a feedforward
 term

 In the transfer function, this is a static gain.
 Thus, one can just remove this static value :

\begin_inset Formula

Model Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the structural model has 
\begin_inset Formula $n-2$
\end_inset

 bending modes.
 The number of nodes chosen is 100 so 98 modes are considered.
 Most of the high frequency modes are inaccurate because of the Euler-Bernoulli
 model which is only suitable for low frequency dynamics.
 Fortunately, these high frequency modes do not contribute much to the system
 dynamics.
 A way to compare every mode contribution is to use the Hankel singular
 values decomposition of the system.
 On Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hsvdGyr"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hsvdAcc"

\end_inset

, the state contribution in the Hankel singular values have been plotted
 for the three different types of sensor.
 The state vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{m}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
q_{mi}\\
q_{moi}
\end{array}\right]_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The first five bending modes will be kept, the others are truncated.
 Indeed, on these bar plots, the contribution of the 
\begin_inset Formula $6^{th}$
\end_inset

 bending mode (bar 11 and 12) and higher (13 and above) is negligeable.
 These modes correspond to less than 0.5% of the singular value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 mode for the strain gauges, less than 1% for the gyroscopes and 5% for
 the accelerometers.

Actuators Selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this paper is to enhance the performance of ASTER 30 by adding
 sensors.
 No actuator will be added from the original ASTER 30 design.
 Indeed adding actuators to an existing missile already in service can be
 very cumbersome and costly.
 The only actuators available are the thrust vectoring by nozzle orientation
 at the very rear of the missile and the fins at the tail of the dart.
 The position of these two actuators on the airframe are 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{nozzle}=0\,m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{fins}=2.4\,m$
\end_inset

.
 These positions corresponds to the nodes 1 and 50.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is assumed that the vibrations are mainly excited by the lateral forces
 generated by these two actuators.
 The aerodynamic forces are too distributed and weak compared to the rocket
 motor lateral thrust at the rear of the booster to create significant bending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only inputs to the vibration system are thus lateral forces at nodes
 1 and 50.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Consider explaining why
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The sensors will be placed only considering the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 bending mode.
 The higher modes have high natural frequencies that cannot be actively
 damped.
 Indeed Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:natFreq"

\end_inset

 gives natural frequencies for the 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{nd}$
\end_inset

 mode and higher above 50Hz which is the cutoff frequency of the fins actuator.
 Moreover the first bending mode is the most critical to damp because it
 generates great vibrations at low frequency and spoil sensors and seeker
 measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step is to select a set of possible locations for a type of sensor.
 Let be 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\{i_{1},i_{2},\dots,i_{s}\}$
\end_inset

 this set with 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 the number of possible locations.
 At each of these locations, an index is calculated which represents the
 ability of the sensor to sense the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 bending mode at this place.
 This index is called 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 for the node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 A simple way to define it is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{i}=\left\Vert G_{1i}\right\Vert _{\infty}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{1i}$
\end_inset

 is the transfer function of 
\begin_inset Formula $[F_{1},F_{50}]$
\end_inset

 to the sensor considered at node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 considering only the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The damping ratio of the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 bending mode is only 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 so the following approximation can be made for the strain gauge and the
 gyroscopes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\Vert G_{1i}\right\Vert _{\infty}\simeq\frac{\left\Vert B_{1}\right\Vert _{2}\left\Vert C_{i1}\right\Vert _{2}}{2\zeta_{1}\omega_{1}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i1}$
\end_inset

 are the input and output matrices at node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 for the sensor considered and the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 bending mode.
 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the first two rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i1}$
\end_inset

 is the first two columns of the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the type of sensor considered knowing that 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\left[\begin{array}{c}
C_{\varepsilon}\\
C_{q}\\
C_{a_{z}}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance for a gyroscope at node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i1}$
\end_inset

is 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{q}(i,1..2)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the accelerometers, the feedforward matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is none zero thus a little modification needs to be done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\Vert G_{1i}\right\Vert _{\infty}\simeq\omega_{1}\frac{\left\Vert B_{1}\right\Vert _{2}\left\Vert C_{i1}\right\Vert _{2}}{2\zeta_{1}\omega_{1}}

The bigger is

 the greater is the amplitude of the signal measured by the sensor at node
 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 Thanks to this method, the locations can be ranked to determine the optimal
 position to place the sensors.
 For each type of sensor - strain gages, gyroscopes and accelerometers -
 this technique will be used.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Strain Gauges Placement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strain gauge is a long resistor fixed on the skin of the structure.
 When the skin is stretched or compressed, the strain gauge is deformed
 and the electrical resistance changes.
 These variations of electrical resistance can be precisely measured with
 a Weathstone bridge.
 The great advantage of this sensor is its insensitivity to the rigid-body
 dynamics of the system.
 This kind of sensor measures only deformation.
 Thus, only one of these sensors appropriately placed can determine the
 flexure of the missile.
 However, it will be shown later that the signal of this sensor needs to
 be derivated to damp the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 mode bending.
 This derivation is likely to increase noise propagation.
 Another disadvantage is its great sensitivity to temperature variation.
 The booster part of the missile is greatly heated by the rocket engine
 and the head of the dart is aerodynamically heated.
 The possible locations are 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[2.2m,\:4.4m]$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to the set of nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\llbracket 46,89\right\rrbracket $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The placement indices have been computed at all locations 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\left\llbracket 2,n-1\right\rrbracket $

\begin_layout Standard
On the bar plot, the placement indices of locations on the booster are very
 low compared to those on the dart.
 Indeed the booster is very stiff so it bends very few compared to the dart.
 The best location for a strain gauge is at node 46 behind the fins at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2.23\,m$
\end_inset

 shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This location corresponds to the strain antinode of the

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Gyroscopes Placement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gyroscope will measure not only the pitch rate due to the vibrations but
 also the pitch rate of the rigid-body.
 For instant, at node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, a gyroscope will measure
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{i}=q_{i,fb}+q
\]

\end_inset

 The isolate the vibrations pitch rate, one needs the measurements of two
 gyroscopes placed at different locations.
 Hence, the pitch rate of the rigid-body can be removed by substraction
 to keep only the vibrations measurement:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{i}-q_{j}=q_{i,fb}-q_{j,fb}
\]

\end_inset

 At least two gyroscopes must be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gyroscope is less sensitive to variations of temperature than a strain
 gauge and can be placed on the booster.
 However a margin is kept with the two extremities of the missile because
 the tail is heated by the engine flame and the nose contains the seeker.
 For the gyroscopes, the set of locations available is then 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\llbracket 10,92\right\rrbracket $

 corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\left[0.45m,\,4.40m\right]$

The nose is a place where the gyroscope would be very sensitive to the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 bending mode.
 Actually, there is already a gyroscope in the sensor pack at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 somewhere between 
\begin_inset Formula $3.9\,m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4.3\,m$
\end_inset

 that correspond approximately to node 83.
 The second gyroscope must be placed at the other side of the zero pitch
 rate node 53.
 The second best position is then node 10.
 These locations are shown on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Accelerometers Placement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accelerometers measure the lateral acceleration due to vibrations but also
 the lateral acceleration of the rigid-body.
 Moreover, the acceleration on the rigid-body depends of where the sensor
 is placed.
 At node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and accelerometer will measure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{z,i}=a_{z,rb,CG}+(x_{CG}-x_{i})\,\dot{q}+a_{z,fb,i}
\]

\end_inset

thus such a measurement contains three unknowns : 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z,rb,CG}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z,fb,i}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore a minimum number of three accelerometers are needed at different
 locations to eleminate the acceleration of the center of gravity and the
 additional term due to pitch acceleration.
 It will be shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Accelerometer-Feedback"

\end_inset

 that the abscissa of the center of gravity does not need to be known to
 extract the acceleration due to the vibrations.
 This is a relief since the position of the center of gravity moves during
 the flight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like a gyroscope, an accelerometer is not as sensible to temperature variations
 as a strain gage.
 Thus it can be placed within 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\left\llbracket 0.45m,\,4.40m\right\rrbracket $
\end_inset

 corresponding to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\llbracket 10,92\right\rrbracket $
\end_inset

.
 Once again, the placement indices are calculated all over the body in Figure

The sensor pack of the missile already contains an accelerometer along the
 z-axis at node 83.
 This position is not very sensible to the first bending mode lateral accelerati
ons as its placement index is very low.
 The sensor pack seems to be placed somewhere next to the vibration acceleration
 node.
 Hence this accelerometer cannot be used for bending vibration control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Flexible Missile Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that the flight dynamics and the structural model have been derived,
 they need to be fused into a servo-aeroelastic model where actuators, flight
 dynamics and structure interact.
 Servo-aeroelastic models can be very complicated to establish therefore
 assumptions will be made on the interactions between the structure and
 the flight dynamics.
 These assumptions being made, the models will be put together and inputs
 and outputs will be defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Structural and Flight Dynamics Interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Trim"

\end_inset

, it has been shown that lift and drag magnitude are each less than 17%
 of the thrust.
 The rocket engine thrust produces the greatest force.
 Thus, it is assumed that the aerodynamics will not create any structural
 deformation.
 Since only bending is considered only the lateral component of the thrust
 is kept for the structural model input.
 Indeed, the longitudinal component of the thrust will create local bending
 moments only when the beam is bent and since the bending deflection is
 only about a few millimeters, this component is neglected.
 The lateral component of the thrust is applied at the tail, on node 1 of
 the structural model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second input to the structural model is the lateral force generated
 by the fins deflection.
 Later, the fins will be used to generate an active damping of the bending
 modes.
 The lateral force generated by these fins is inserted at node 50 of the
 structural model.
 The lift they generate is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{fins}=\frac{1}{2}\rho SV_{0}^{2}C_{L\delta_{F}}\delta_{F}
\]

\end_inset

The lift generated by the angle of attack 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is not considered since it is assumed that the body aerodynamics do not
 generate bending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inputs to the flight dynamics are the thrust vectoring and the fins
 deflection.
 These two angles are controlled by second-order actuators of bandwidth
 of 25Hz and 50Hz before the flight dynamics block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last assumption is that the bending will not change the aerodynamic
 of the missile.
 Indeed the deformation is very little.
 The bending deflection is about a few millimeters that will not change
 the aerodynamic coefficients significantly.
 Therefore the structural model outputs will not be inputs of the flight
 dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Servo-Aeroelastic Model Inputs and Outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flexible missile inputs and outputs can be classified of 5 types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Control inputs
\series default
: These inputs will be used by the controller to generate a lateral acceleration
 or to damp the bending modes.
 There are two: the thrust vectoring reference orientation 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{Tref}$
\end_inset

 which commands the orientation of the nozzles with a second-order actuator
 and the fins reference deflection 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{Fref}$
\end_inset

 that is the input of a second-order actuator controlling the fins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Sensors outputs
\series default
: There are several sensors providing information on the system.
 They can be accelerometers, gyroscopes or a strain gauge.
 The accelerometers and gyroscopes have a component from the flight dynamics
 model also called the rigid-body component and another from the structural
 model called the flexible-body component or vibration component.
 The strain gauge only measures the strain at node 46 from the structural
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Perturbation inputs
\series default
: Some signals are perturbated by inputs.
 These inputs can either be sensor noise like for the accelerometers or
 gyroscopes or perturbation forces from the rocket engine or on the fins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Reference acceleration
\series default
: This input signal is generated by the navigation manager that often follow
 a proportional navigation.
 This is the reference to follow for the lateral acceleration controller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Performance outputs
\series default
: They are additional outputs like the acceleration at centre of gravity,
 the nozzles and fins angle or the vibration components of sensors that
 cannot be measured but will be used to design or assess the controllers.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Missile Control Inputs and Outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To control the flexible missile, several inputs and outputs are available.
 This Section discuss about those which will be used for the lateral acceleratio
n control and others for the active damping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Actuators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original ASTER 30 uses the orientatable nozzles to control the missile
 lateral acceleration.
 The nozzles are actuated with hydraulic cylinders.
 The thrust deflection creates a lateral force on the tail of the missile
 creating a pitching moment at the missile centre of gravity.
 This will change its angle of attack and generate a lateral acceleration.
 Because of the hydraulic system and the great force requiered to actuate
 the nozzles, this actuator is relatively slow.
 Its bandwidth is about 25Hz which is fast enough to control the lateral
 acceleration and will be used for the lateral acceleration control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thrust vectoring might be too slow for actively damp the first bending
 mode.
 Thus, the dart fins will be used.
 Indeed, these fins are actuated by electric power and the efforts on these
 control surfaces is lower hence there bandwidth is about 50Hz.
 The first bending mode frequency is at 20Hz so the fins are fast enough
 to perform an active damping.
 Moreover, the fins deflection generate a lateral force at the missile centre.
 On the first bending mode shape, this is approximatively were the lateral
 displacement is maximum.
 The fins actuator has a great influence on the first bending mode.
 These reasons justify the use of fins to damp the bending vibrations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sensors pack included in the original version of ASTER 30 contains an
 accelerometer and a gyroscope close to the nose.
 These sensors are the only two needed for the lateral acceleration control.
 With the missile modification presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:sensorPlacement"

\end_inset

, several sensors have been added including a strain gauge, gyroscopes and
 accelerometers.
 They provide information on the bending state of the missile and will be
 used for the structural active damping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Lateral Acceleration Control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common feedback architecture to control the lateral acceleration generation
 uses a pitch rate feedback plus a proportional integral controller on the
 lateral acceleration.
 In the case of a simple rigid missile, the bending is not considered.
 To control the lateral acceleration, the closed-loop architecture is described
 on Figure

 Thus, if the command signal generated has a non zero component at the bending

 This oscillation is measured by the sensors and fed through the controller
 which could amplify it.

Even if the feedback gains are kept little to avoid a structural instability,
 the vibrations created by the rocket engine are amplified through the structure

 This amplified signal will generate parasistic actuations of the thrust
 vectoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several strategies to deal with the bending oscillation.
 The first one is currently used by missile manufacturers and consists in
 filtering the input command to the actuator using a notch filter.
 This technique will be developped further in the next subsection.
 Now that new sensors have been added on the airframe, the measurements
 they provide can be used to actively damp the bending oscillations.
 Feedback architectures based on the strain measurement, on pitch rate measureme
nts and on the accelerometer measurements will be investigated in the following
 subsections.

Notch Filtering
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:notchFilter"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notch filter is applied to the command of the thrust vectoring.
 This filter will remove any signal of the bending mode frequency.
 The first step is to choose an appropriate type of filter.
 A Chebyshev Type II filter suits the problem because there is no ripple
 in the bandwidth that could create gain distorsion and affect performance
 at low frequency.
 However, this type of filter requires a high order denominator to ensure
 a sharp gain loss.
 The filter center frequency is set to 20Hz with a stopband bandwith of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm10\%$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, the uncertainty on the first bending mode frequency is about 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm10\%$
\end_inset

.
 The gain loss is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $40\,dB$
\end_inset

.
 The order of the filter is 4.
 With these criterias, the corresponding Chebyshev Type II filter is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(s)=\frac{s^{4}+\left(3.19\cdot10^{4}\right)\,s^{2}+2.49\cdot10^{8}}{s^{4}+239.0\,s^{3}+\left(6.04\cdot10^{4}\right)\,s^{2}+\left(3.77\cdot10^{6}\right)\,s+2.49\cdot10^{8}}

 The phase loss brought by this notch filter is already 
\begin_inset Formula $-100°$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $70\,rad.s^{-1}$
\end_inset

 that may bring poorer performance even at low frequencies.
 A higher order notch filter could also be chosen to obtain a sharper band-stop.

Active Structural Damping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notch filter is a simple solution to deal with vibrations but it does
 not remove them.
 Another way to overcome bending oscillations is to artificially augment
 the damping ratio of the bending mode.
 This is called active structural damping.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Requirements
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Requirements"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The controller must generate a force that is opposite to the vibration speed
 to damp the bending oscillations.
 To do so, the controller can either use the thrust vectoring or the central
 fins.
 The natural frequency of the first mode is 20Hz.
 The bandwidth of the thrust vectoring is about 25Hz which is too low: at
 20Hz, the thrust vectoring actuator has a phase loss of -70° and a gain
 loss of -1.5dB as shown on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bodeThrustVect"

\end_inset

.
 This is very close to the cutoff frequency and the real behaviour of the
 actuator at this frequency is not accurately modeled.

The fins have a bandwith of 50Hz that is more than the double of the bending
 mode frequency.
 The phase loss at 20Hz is only -34° and the gain loss is -0.1dB as shown
 on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bodeFins"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore this fast actuator is to be prefered for active damping of the
 first bending mode.
 Moreover, the fins are located in the middle where the flexure is important
 therefore they have an important controllability of the first bending mode.
 Also, at the first bending mode frequency, the fins deflection have very
 little influence on the slow rigid-body dynamics.
 Moreover, they are located close to the center of gravity so they do not
 create a big change in the angle of attack.
 The fins will be used to actively damp the bending vibrations.

Strain Feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strain gauge is a sensor that is usually not present on a missile airframe.
 With this extra sensor, it possible to measure the local strain on the
 skin of the structure to infere on its flexure.
 This additional information can help to deal with bending oscillation.
 If only the first bending mode is considered, the transfer function of
 the fins deflection to the strain can be approximated to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\varepsilon_{46}}{\delta_{F}}(s)=K_{\nicefrac{\varepsilon}{\delta_{F}}}\frac{\omega_{1}^{2}}{s^{2}+2\,\zeta_{1}\,\omega_{1}\,s+\omega_{1}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To increase the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{1}$
\end_inset

 with a simple feedback, the strain measurement needs to be derivated as
 shown in the block diagram in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:strainFB1"

\end_inset

.
 The transfer function of the closed-loop would then be 
\end_layout

\[
\left(\frac{\varepsilon_{46}}{\delta_{F}}\right)_{CL}(s)=K_{\nicefrac{\varepsilon}{\delta_{F}}}\frac{\omega_{1}^{2}}{s^{2}+2\,(\zeta_{1}+\frac{1}{2}K_{\nicefrac{\varepsilon}{\delta_{F}}}\omega_{1}K_{\varepsilon})\,\omega_{1}\,s+\omega_{1}^{2}}

 or the natural frequency

 However this feedback is non causal and a pole needs to be added.
 This artificial pole can be placed very fast to minimize its influence
 on the dynamics.

K\,\frac{s}{1+\nicefrac{s}{\omega_{fast}}}

This feedback loop would work if the fins actuator was very fast.
 This is not the case because even if its bandwith is twice bigger than
 the bending mode natural frequency, the phase loss is non negligeable as
 shown in

Fortunately with this phase shift a simple proportional feedback will damp
 the bending oscillations.
 On Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, a root locus has been plotted with the full dynamics of all 5 bending
 modes, flight dynamics and actuator dynamics.
 With a proportional feedback gain of 600, the damping ratio of the first
 bending mode has been increased by 10 to 12.5%.
 This gain is chosen to obtain a gain margin of 6dB and a phase margin of
 30°.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feedback architecture has some disadvantages though.
 The strain measured is not only coming from bending deformations.
 Some longitudinal or twisting modes may create local strains and propagate
 noise in the system.
 Moreover, without an appropriate band-pass filter, the static bending will
 create a static deflection of the fins and increase drag.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Gyroscope Feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two gyroscopes can give information on the flexure.
 A gyroscope is placed at the rear and the other one is the gyroscope included
 in the sensor pack next to the nose.
 The problem with damping bending with gyroscopes is that they measure not
 only the local pitch rate of the bending but also the rigid-body pitch
 rate.
 Thus two of them are needed to substract the rigid-body pitch rate.
 Indeed, a gyro at node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 will measure 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=q_{RB}+q_{FBi}$
\end_inset

.
 The substraction of the signals coming from the two gyroscopes will give:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{10}-q_{83}=q_{fb,10}-q_{fb,83}=\Delta q
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If only the first bending mode is considered, the transfer function of the
 fins deflection 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{F}$
\end_inset

 to the pitch rate difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta q$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\Delta q}{\delta_{F}}(s)=K_{\nicefrac{\Delta q}{\delta_{F}}}\frac{\omega_{1}^{2}\,s}{s^{2}+2\,\zeta_{1}\,\omega_{1}\,s+\omega_{1}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

thus with a simple proportional feedback gain 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\Delta q}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta q$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{F}$
\end_inset

 would modify the transfer function to

This feedback would damp the first bending mode without modifying the other
 parameters.
 Now considering the phase loss of the actuator of about 30°, the natural
 frequency of the first bending mode will change but damping is still possible.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This controller architecture has the disadvantage that the two gyroscopes
 must be similarily calibrated and synchronized to perform the substraction
 correctly.
 The great advantage is the absence of fins deflection in static.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Accelerometer Feedback
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Accelerometer-Feedback"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using accelerometers for the feedback is more complicated than using gyroscopes.
 At node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, the accelerometer will measure 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z,i}=a_{z,CG}+(x_{CG}-x_{i})\,\dot{q}+a_{zi,fb}$
\end_inset

.
 There are three unknowns in this equality: 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z,CG}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{zi,fb}$
\end_inset

 hence three uncorrelated accelerometers are needed to keep only the flexible
 body component.
 On the airframe, three accelerometers have been added at node 10, 53 and
 92.
 Considering only the first bending mode, all the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{zi,fb}$
\end_inset

 are proportional to the first bending mode mean acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z,m1}$
\end_inset

.
 A linear combination of these three measurements must be found so that
 it does not depend of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{z,CG}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

.
 Let (
\begin_inset Formula $c_{10}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{53}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{92}$
\end_inset

) be three coefficients so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{10}a_{z,10}+c_{53}a_{z,53}+c_{92}a_{z,92}=c\,a_{z,m1}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a non zero real number.
 Let say that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{10}=1$
\end_inset

 to make the linear system of Cramer.
 In a matrix form, this gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 1\\
9 & 52 & 91\\
1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{10}\\
c_{53}\\
c_{92}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{10}\\
c_{53}\\
c_{92}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
-\nicefrac{82}{39}\\
\nicefrac{43}{39}
\end{array}\right].$
\end_inset

 The linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{10}a_{z,10}+c_{53}a_{z,53}+c_{92}a_{z,92}$
\end_inset

 will be called 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum a_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 The transfer function of the fins deflection to this linear combination
 of accelerations is of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sum a_{z}}{\delta_{F}}(s)=K_{\nicefrac{\sum a_{z}}{\delta_{F}}}\frac{\omega_{1}^{2}\,s^{2}}{s^{2}+2\,\zeta_{1}\,\omega_{1}\,s+\omega_{1}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

hence to damp the first bending mode, the feedback needs an integrator so
 that the resulting transfer function would be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sum a_{z}}{\delta_{F}}_{CL}(s)=K_{\nicefrac{\sum a_{z}}{\delta_{F}}}\frac{\omega_{1}^{2}\,s^{2}}{s^{2}+2\,(\zeta_{1}+K_{\nicefrac{\sum a_{z}}{\delta_{F}}}\omega_{1}K_{a_{z}})\,\omega_{1}\,s+\omega_{1}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

Like for the gyroscopes, the phase loss of the fins actuator will generate
 a change in the bending oscillation natural frequency.

\begin_layout Standard
Four controller architectures will be assesed.
 They all have in common the lateral acceleration control composed of a
 pitch rate feedback and a proportional integral controller on the lateral
 acceleration.
 The first architecture has a notch filter.
 The controller number 2 to 4 use active damping with respectively:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the strain gauge feedback,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the 2 gyroscopes feedback,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the 3 accelerometers feedback.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Each architecture is put in a weighted form like on Figure

 The input to the closed-loop system is the exogenous vector 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 which contains all the inputs like noises, perturbations or references.
 The output is the performance vector 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 containing all the performance indices that one will minimize.
 The diagonal matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{in}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{out}$
\end_inset

 are weights applied to 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 to define the requirements.
 The algorithm will tune the controller gains in order to make the system
 stable while minimizing

 such that

The parameters subject to tuning are 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{q}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{PI}$
\end_inset

.
 The notch filter, the strain feedback, the gyroscopes feedback or the accelerom

 They are defined in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exogenous vector 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 only contains the reference lateral acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{zref}$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding weight is set to 1.
 Thus, the other signals weights will be chosen according to a reference
 acceleration of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\,m.s^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Additional inputs are not needed, first of all because the tuning needs
 to be simple but also because other inputs like noise, actuators perturbations
 or gust perturbations are neglected.
 The sensors noise is very low compared to signals generated by vibrations.
 The fins actuator perturbations is assumed to be very few compared to the
 thrust vectoring perturbations which will not be considered for tuning
 but later for assessment.
 Finally, gusts have a speed which is negligeable compared to the missile
 speed of Mach 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The performance vector 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is composed of two signals: the lateral acceleration error 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{zref}-a_{zCG}$
\end_inset

 and the thrust vectoring orientation 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{T}$
\end_inset

.
 It is obvious that the lateral acceleration error is needed in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 to design a lateral acceleration controller.
 The thrust vectoring orientation 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{T}$
\end_inset

 is added in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 to limitate the use of this actuator which has a rate limit, a deflection
 limit and second-order dynamics.
 The output weight matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{out}$
\end_inset

 is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
W_{err} & 0\\
0 & W_{\theta_{T}}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $W_{err}$
\end_inset

 is set to minimize the error at low frequency and bound it at high frequency
 for resonance reduction.
 The controller is equiped with an integrator so the error will tend to
 0.
 An empirical tuning of this weight is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W_{err}(s)=\frac{5}{s}\,\left(\frac{s}{10}+1\right)
\]

\end_inset

which will force the bandwidth to be 5 rad/s.
 And the maximum error will be 2 times the reference acceleration.
 The target shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{a_{zref}\rightarrow\left(a_{zref}-a_{zCG}\right)}(s)$
\end_inset

 will be the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{err}(s)$
\end_inset

 and is plotted in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $W_{\theta_{T}}$

 is chosen avoid using the actuator over its cutoff frequency.
 A simple way to do this is to chose 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W_{\theta_{T}}(s)=2\cdot10^{-3}\left(\frac{s}{\omega_{T}}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{1}{1+10^{-5}s}\right)^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{T}$
\end_inset

 is the thrust vectoring cutoff frequency of 25Hz (157 rad/s).
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $2\cdot10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 is empirically set.
 To have a causal weight, two fast poles are added.
 Once again, the target shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{a_{zref}\rightarrow\theta_{T}}(s)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{W_{\theta_{T}}(s)}$
\end_inset

.
 The rotation speed of the thrust vectoring must also be bounded.
 The system being linear, trying to minimize 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{T}$
\end_inset

 will also minimise 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta_{T}}$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding bound will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{s}{W_{\theta_{T}}}$

Robustness to Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first criteria to assess is robustness to uncertainty.
 The H
\begin_inset Formula $_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 algorithm found stable solutions for the five architectures but they can
 turn unstable with some parameters variation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uncertainty has been defined considering the thrust, the center of gravity,
 the bending modes natural frequencies and their damping ratios as uncertain
 parameters.
 The thrust is generated by the rocket engine and is then very uncertain.
 The center of gravity moves along the flight because of the propellant
 combustion.
 Finally the bending modes natural frequency and espacially damping are
 often poorly identified and they vary.
 These parameters uncertainties are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Parameters-Uncertainty"

\end_inset

.
 Other parameters could also be defined as uncertain like the actuators
 bandwidth, the modes shapes, the aerodynamic coefficients and so on but
 this should require a specific study.

Looking at these too figures, the four different closed-loop architectures
 yield very similar tracking performance.
 The rise time from 10 to 90% following a step demand is between

Actuators Demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thrust nozzles cylinders and the fins actuators have second order dynamics
 and actuators demand must be limited at high frequency.
 These demands must also be limited over the whole range of frequencies
 to save energy and to avoid actuators heating and damage.

Demand for Lateral Acceleration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The actuators demand following a lateral acceleration command must be appropriat
ely bounded.
 The weight

 ensures that the position and rate of the thrust vectoring stays bounded
 under a reasonable threshold.

Parasitic Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bending vibrations are a source of parasitic actuations on the thrust vectoring.
 Indeed, the vibrations will generate parasitic signals in the sensors measureme
nts then propagated through the controller and to the thrust vectoring.
 The bending vibrations are mostly generated by the rocket engine which
 thrust magnitude and orientation is very noisy.
 The parasitic actuations can be observed on the singular values from a
 perturbation on the thrust orientation to the actuated nozzles orientation

\begin_layout Subsection
Bending Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, it has been seen that an architecture with a notch
 filter or with active damping have similar tracking performance, and a
 good rocket engine noise rejection.
 The difference between them appears when it comes to dynamic bending reduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Vibrations Allevation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The active damping architectures have the advantage of reducing bending
 vibrations.
 ASTER 30 sensors pack is equipped with several tracking and attitude control
 sensors.
 They are greatly sensitive to vibrations and filtering always brings delays.
 The active damping will thoroughly reduce vibrations and hence improve
 tracking and attitude control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rocket engine creating a noisy thrust is the main source of bending
 vibrations.
 The singular values of this propagation is shown on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{Tpert}$
\end_inset

Dynamic Stress Alleviation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By reducing bending oscillations, the active damping will also reduce stress
 due to dynamic deformations.
 The junction between the booster and the dart is located where the flexure
 due to the first bending mode is maximum.
 Therefore this link must be very stiff and resistant to flexure.
 With active damping, this link can be lighten and simplified.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:sigmaFlexure"

 shows the strain reduction with active damping compared to non active damping
 next to the link.
 The source of vibrations is again the rocket engine thrust orientation
 noise.

Results and Discussions
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "chap:results"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thesis has investigated structural damping on a slender missile ASTER
 30.
 A flight dynamics model has been derived coupled with a structural model.
 This flexible missile model is the foundation on which sensors have been
 placed at optimal locations for structural damping purposes.
 Several lateral acceleration controllers were created and assessed which
 three of them use active damping.
 These steps will be discussed recalling the assumptions made, the results
 obtained and their scope of validity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flight Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flight dynamics are based on a simple longitudinal model at Mach 2 and
 sea level.
 The aerodynamics modeling uses global linear aerodynamic coefficients that
 have been obtained from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lesieutre2002MISL3"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fleeman2006tactical"

\end_inset

 with slight changes.
 Flight of slender bodies is generally highly nonlinear but for simplification
 purposes, it has been assumed linear.
 This might create inconsistancies at high angle of attack.
 The equations are therefore valid within very small variations from the
 trim state.
 However, the purpose of the study is to demonstrate the feasability of
 active damping and not to accurately design a functional controller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the SPPO is considered as a mode in this model.
 The reason for this is that slower dynamics like the phugoïd have a time
 scale which belongs to navigation issue and not lateral acceleration generation.
 The SPPO natural frequency was calculated at ???Hz with a damping ratio
 of ??? which is realistic.
 The SPPO dynamics set a limit to the fastest reponse to generate latax
 with the proposed feedback architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Actuators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASTER 30 has two actuators to control the flight, thrust vectoring nozzles
 and fins.
 The transfer functions from the demanded angles of deflection of these
 actuators and the realised angles have been assumed to be of second order.
 This assumption might be a little extreme especially for the thrust vectoring
 which dynamic is very complex and non linear.
 Indeed the thrust magnitude is so intense that the nozzles might bend due
 to backlash.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Structural Modeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The missile has been modeled using a discretized method using point masses
 and massless beams.
 This structural stiffness of the beam has been estimated assuming that
 the missile skin is in carbon fibre and divided in two pipes of similar
 thickness but different diameters.
 The real structural composition of the missile is probably very different
 with anisotropic materials, variable thickness.
 The mass is not uniformly distributed as assumed.
 Of course knowing the exact mass distribution and structural stiffness,
 the model can be adapted to be more accurate.
 Also one assumption was that pur moments and rotational inertias are negligeabl
e which might be false especially at the fins location or about the missile
 warhead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Servo-aeroelastic Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final model of the missile takes account of the longitudinal flight
 dynamics, the actuators dynamics and the bending.
 Interactions between these three models are very limited since the structure
 deformation is only influenced by thrust vectoring and fins forces.
 The aerodynamics are supposed to bring no bending since the thrust is the
 main force.
 However, the source of vibrations is not important to be clearly identified
 as long as these vibrations are damped thoroughly.
 The controllers designed react to bending oscillations no matter where
 they come from.
 To model bending due to aerodynamics, it would have require to use data
 on local pressure coefficients all along the body which vary with angle
 of attack, pitch rate and are time varying.
 This would bring additional complexity that is not needed in this study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the bending deformation is supposed to have no influence
 on the aerodynamics.
 Since the bending deflection is very limited, the shape of the missile
 does not change significantly and its flight characteristics remain unchanged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Sensors Placement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional sensors where placed all along the body.
 These sensors add information about the flexure of the missile to allow
 active damping.
 They were of three types: strain gauge, gyroscopes and accelerometers.
 Using the H
\begin_inset Formula $_{\infty}$
\end_inset

-norm, an index has been defined to locate the best positions to place each
 sensor.
 It has been proved that one strain gauge is necessary but two gyroscopes
 and three accelerometers are need to have enough information on the missile
 bending.
 The optimal location for the strain gauge is in the middle of the missile.
 The gyroscopes must be placed at each extremity.
 Since a gyroscope is already present in the sensors pack, only one has
 been added on the tail.
 Finally, the accelerometers were placed at the tail, the middle and the
 nose.
 The accelerometer from the sensors pack of ASTER is located at an acceleration
 node of the first bending mode and has a very limited sensitivity of this
 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Damping controllers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three controllers have been designed with the measurements provided by the
 additional sensors.
 One uses the strain gauge, the second one uses the gyroscopes and the last
 one uses three accelerometers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first architecture is based on the phase loss of the fins actuator and
 can be faulty if the actuator is not properly modelled.
 Indeed if the actuator has a faster reaction time and the phase loss is
 close to 0°, the loop would increase the natural frequency of the bending
 mode and not damp it.
 The feedback uses the measurement from a single strain gauge.
 Since strain gauge are resistors, they are very sensitive to temperature
 and are not reliable.
 Moreover, they measure the local strain that can be due to other structural
 modes like twisting or longitudinal stretch and compression.
 The advantage is that they are very cost effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second architecture requires the substraction of two pitch rate measurements
 whereas the third one needs three accelerometers.
 The performance from both architectures is very similar however the gyroscopes
 feedback uses less the fins at low frequencies.
 The advantage of the accelerometers feedback is the use of an integrator
 that will minimize high frequency noise sent to the actuator.
 The use of gyroscopes must be prefered though because only one additional
 gyrometer is need whereas it is three for the accelerometers.
 Accelerometers also measure gravity and it must be removed using the attitude
 and gravity magnitude estimations which is a disadvantage compared to gyroscope
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been shown that these three architectures actively damp bending oscillati
ons generated by the rocket engine whereas the conventional architecture
 using a notch filter do not.
 Tracking performance is identical for all of the architectures tested.
 The criterias used to asses each controller are summarized in Table

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Active structural damping on a tactical missile has been investigated.
 A linear time-invariant model of the flexible missile has been derived
 using classical flight dynamics coupled with a discretized dynamic Euler
 Bernoulli beam.
 To measure the missile flexure, additional sensors - a strain gauge, two
 gyroscopes and three accelerometers - have been placed at optimal locations
 on the airframe.
 Several active damping controllers have been designed and assessed according
 to multiples criterias.
 The feedback loop using gyroscopes being prefered for the robustness of
 these sensors, the low number required and its low control power consumption
 compared to other architectures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Active structural damping is feasible on ASTER 30 for the first bending
 mode.
 The prior limiting factor being often the slow actuator dynamics.
 ASTER 30 slenderness makes the bending mode natural frequency low and the
 fins have a bandwidth large enough to perform active damping.
 The benefits of such a control are principaly vibrations alleviation for
 the seeker leading to an enhanced tracking of the target.

\begin_layout Section
Further Developments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this study arises several possible further developments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only a limited number of sensors have been added on the airframe.
 However, some of these sensors are not only sensitive to the first bending
 mode but also to other bending modes, twisting modes, compression modes
 and so forth.
 Augmenting the number of sensors might reinforce confidence in the flexure
 prediction.
 Furthermore, the sensors have been placed at peaks of placement indices
 which might not be the best considering several sensors.
 For instance the accelerometers must be three and have been placed at the
 three peaks of the placement index.
 Once placed, a linear combination of their signal has been done to remove
 rigid-body components.
 What can be done is finding the linear combination with respect to the
 position of each sensor named 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 then compute the placement index for the triple (
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 This will give a three dimensional array of placement indices and will
 find the optimal location for the three sensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the additional sensors, estimation of the missile state can be reinforced
 using Kalman filtering.
 Moreover, the array of accelerometers provide information on CG acceleration
 but also on pitch rate acceleration.
 The pitch rate acceleration measurement can be used to anticipate on pitching
 moments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three architectures proposed use simple SISO loops and the feedback
 is generally a static gain.
 It might be useful to add a band-pass filter centered on the first bending
 mode frequency to avoid using the fins outside of this band.
 Indeed the strain gauge feedback and the accelerometers feedback use the
 fins even at frequencies that do not correspond to the bending oscillation.
 This would save control energy and diminish interactions between lateral
 acceleration control and active structural damping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study has been focused on bending but it could be enlarged to a 3D model
 to consider all structural modes such as twisting.
 The fins are able to generate lateral forces but also twisting moments
 to damp twisting modes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally an approach can be tracking performance enhancing.
 The missile can be made more slender and the SPPO can be faster by augmenting
 the static margin.
 These two modifications would bring the bending natural frequency and short
 period frequency closer.
 A notch filter would be unusable in such a case.
 Thus, considering the flexible missile as a whole, an optimal controller
 could be designed to maximize lateral acceleration settling time.
